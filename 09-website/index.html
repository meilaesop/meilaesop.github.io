      <p>
        But down there it would be dark now, and not the lovely lighted aquarium
        she imagined it to be during the daylight hours, eddying with schools of
        tiny, delicate animals floating and dancing slowly to their own serene
        currents and creating the look of a living painting. That was wrong, in
        any case. The ocean was different from an aquarium, which was an
        artificial environment. The ocean was a world. And a world is not art.
        Dorothy thought about the living things that moved in that world: large,
        ruthless and hungry. Like us up here.
